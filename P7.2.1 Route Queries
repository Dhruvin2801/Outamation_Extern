We'll upload a real multi-page PDF, extract text from each page, classify the document type, and use metadata filtering to quickly match queries like “How much money did I make?” to relevant content such as pay stubs. This approach keeps retrieval fast, explainable, and cost-effective.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"onhxlcVhA24b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Download the necessary packages\n","!pip install
